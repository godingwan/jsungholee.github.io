## Choosing a language

I have had to use a different language almost every semester and, while I have been able to get a general idea of java, c(++), and ruby, I cannot claim to be confident in any one language 
and so I have decided to pick Java as my main language. 

Java has numerous resources online that I can look online if I ever encounter a road block. I also have close friends who are comfortable with Java 
that I can also turn to whenever I have questions. 

The most important reason I chose Java is because it can do mobile, web, and desktop development all with one language. Of course Java might not be the best language to use depending on the 
situation but having a language that is able to do multiple things is reassuring that I will be able to work on most projects without having to learn the syntax and nuances of a new language.

## Practicing Java

In order to practice Java I will be using [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com), specifically the [algorithm section](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms/warmup). 

## Goal

I want to be able to answer the technical interview questions comfortably in Java without having to worry about syntax errors.
