## About

Hello! My name is Joshua Lee. I am a software engineer with a soft spot for psychology. I graduated from <a href="www.uncc.edu" target="_blank">UNC Charlotte</a> with a B.S. in Computer Science 
and from <a href="www.unc.edu" target="_blank">UNC Chapel Hill</a> with a B.S. in psychology. 

I have a passion for technology and its innovative presence on society. One of my favorite topics is Artificial Intelligence. Anything dealing with the human mind and how it's intelligent behavior 
can be captured in the form of computational processes encourages me to become a stronger developer.

I have also fallen in love with <a href="https://golang.org/" target="_blank">Golang</a> with its robost built in concurrency library and simple to use http handler. I have built scalable and 
concurrent API and am always looking for new projects to write with Golang.

My goal is to always develop useful and problem solving applications. I believe one of the most satisfying aspects of being a programmer is seeing code you wrote deployed in a live system and used by real people, 
especially if it improves their lives in some way. I always looking for oportunities to utilize my background in psychology and programming to deliver effective technical solutions.
