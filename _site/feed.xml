				<title>Calm Before the Storm</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;My first day of “senior year” is tomorrow. It is difficult to gauge what year I am in since this is my second bachelor. Taking mostly computer science classes every semester has been tough but 
it was nice to be able to focus solely on computer science. I have finally finished all of the foundational courses such as data structures, algorithms, and linear algebra and can take courses that 
I find interesting such as internet security and data mining. I must now focus on finishing senior year with good grades while also keeping a look out for jobs. Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;
