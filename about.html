## About

My name is Joshua Lee. I am an aspiring software engineer with a soft spot for psychology. I graduated from <a href="www.unc.edu" target="_blank">UNC Chapel Hill</a> with a B.S. in psychology
and am currently in the process of finishg my B.S. in computer science from <a href="www.uncc.edu" target="_blank">UNC Charlotte</a>.

I have a passion for technology and its innovative presence on society. One of my favorite topics is Artificial Intelligence. Anything dealing with the human mind and how it's intelligent behavior 
can be captured in the form of computational processes encourages me to become a stronger engineer.

My immediate goal is to develop useful applications. I believe one of the most satisfying aspects of being a programmer is seeing code you wrote deployed in a live system and used by real people, 
especially if it improves their lives in some way. I look forward to utilizing my background in psychology and programming to deliver technical solutions and contribute to innovations in the 
artificial intelligence space.
